<p>If you’re not sure whether you like the direction the country is heading toward, how likely are you to approve of President Trump’s job performance?</p>
<p>Taking a look at the Pew Research Center’s “September 2018 Political Survey,” the latest dataset publicly available on the center’s site, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/download-datasets/" class="uri">https://www.pewresearch.org/download-datasets/</a>, the answer surprises me at least.</p>

<p>So if you’re not sure about the country’s direction, there’s a roughly equal chance that you approve of Trump’s job performance, disapprove or aren’t sure. At least that was the case in September of last year.</p>
