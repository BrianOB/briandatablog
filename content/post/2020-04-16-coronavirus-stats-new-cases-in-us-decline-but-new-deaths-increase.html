<p>An update on my earlier coronavirus post showing some good and bad news for the United States. Specifically, the number of new cases has decreased but the number of new deaths spiked. The spike could be a reporting issue. It’s too early to tell.</p>
<p>The obvious caveats are that the daily number of new Covid-19 cases and coronavirus-related deaths rely on the accurate testing of patients and the willingness of countries to share data with their own citizens and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here’s what the data shows about daily new cases and new deaths reported in the United States and worldwide.</p>

<p>Here are the latest stats on the testing in the United States. The periodic dips are due to fewer tests being done (or at least reported) on the weekends.</p>
