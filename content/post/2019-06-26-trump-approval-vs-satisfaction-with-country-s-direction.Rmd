If you're not sure whether you like the direction the country is heading toward, how likely are you to approve of President Trump's job performance?

Taking a look at the Pew Research Center's "September 2018 Political Survey," the latest dataset publicly available on the center's site, https://www.pewresearch.org/download-datasets/, the answer surprises me at least.

```{r echo=F, message=F}

library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(survey)

# load data
sept18 <- read_sav('c:/users/brian/documents/mystuff/projects/api_stuff/data_raw/Sept18 public.sav', user_na = T) %>% 
  as_factor()

# create survey design
sept18_design = svydesign(
         ids = ~0, #formula indicating there are no clusters  
         data = sept18,      #this is the dataset 
         weights = ~weight) #this is the 'weight' variable from the dataset

# get q1 by q2
q1_by_q2 = svyby(~q2,            #variable to estimate
                   ~q1,          #subgroup variable
                   design = sept18_design,
                   FUN = svymean, #function to use on each subgroup
                   keep.names = FALSE #does not include row.names 
                                       #for subgroup variable
      ) 

# clean it up
q1_by_q2 <- q1_by_q2 %>% 
  select(q1, Approve = q2Approve, Disapprove = q2Disapprove, "Don't know/Refused" = `q2(VOL) Don't know/Refused`) %>% 
  gather(key=q2, value=Percent, Approve, Disapprove, `Don't know/Refused`)

levels(q1_by_q2$q1) <- c('Satisfied','Dissatisfied',"Don't know/Refused")

# plot it
q1_by_q2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=q1, y=Percent, group=q2, fill=q2)) +
  geom_col(position='dodge') +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('green','red','orange')) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(title="Trump approval by how satisfied people are with the country's direction",
       x='All in all, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in this country today?',
       subtitle='Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as President?') +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), plot.subtitle=element_text(size=10),
        axis.title.x=element_text(size=10))

```

So if you're not sure about the country's direction, there's a roughly equal chance that you approve of Trump's job performance, disapprove or aren't sure. At least that was the case in September of last year.
