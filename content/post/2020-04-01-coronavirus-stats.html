<p>I know there are a lot of visualizations dealing with the coronavirus, but sometimes I think they get so complex that they hide a few key points. So here’s my take on them using data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>
<p>The obvious caveats are that the daily number of new Covid-19 cases and coronavirus-related deaths rely on the accurate testing of patients and the willingness of countries to share data with their own citizens and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here’s what the data shows about daily new cases and new deaths reported in the United States and worldwide. Note that both are still ramping upward.</p>

<p>By comparison, here’s what is apparently happening in China, which is what we want the trend to be in the United States and worldwide.</p>

<p>Finally, here is what is apparently happening in Italy. It looks like new cases and new deaths are starting to decline, but it’s still pretty ugly.</p>
