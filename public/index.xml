      <description>How does Pittsburgh’s public sector employment compare to that of other metro areas? In this first glance, I’m going to focus on what percentage of the metro area’s jobs are government jobs.
The data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly survey of state and local employment. I use the annual averages, so the latest data is for 2017.
Looking at 444 metro areas in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, the concentration of public-sector employment in 2017 ranged from a low of 6.</description>

      <description>I set up this site to publish data analyses and possibly some occasional musings. The site was created using the R blogdown package in RStudio.
The theme was forked from @jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme and modified by Yihui Xie. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few tweaks.</description>
