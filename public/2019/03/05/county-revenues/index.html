<p>The data comes from the annual reports the counties file with the state Department of Community and Economic Development and can be found, in more detail, here: <a href="http://munstats.pa.gov/Reports/ReportInformation2.aspx?report=cAfrForm" class="uri">http://munstats.pa.gov/Reports/ReportInformation2.aspx?report=cAfrForm</a></p>
<p>I plan to post some of the spending data next as well as a look at how each county’s debt compares to its total revenues and tax revenues. Down the line, I plan to do the same with municipalities but their reports follow a different format that I have yet to decipher.</p>
