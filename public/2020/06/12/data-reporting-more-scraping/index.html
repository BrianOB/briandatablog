<p>A fellow reporter, Jason Kandel, asked me to look at how to use Google Sheets to scrape wildfire information from this site: <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/" class="uri">https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/accessible-view/</a></p>
<p>I’ve had mixed success using Google Sheets as a scraper but I managed to come up with a kludge that requires manual updates as fires get added to the list (which seems to be fairly often based on my limited experience with the site). So this looked like a perfect use of an R script. After some tinkering, here’s what I came up with.</p>

<p>The console output started out as a debugging measure because one of the incident pages was down when I was working on the script and it caused an error that halted the script. The printout let me see which url was causing the problem. I kept the output because it gives a nice view of what is now contained in the <em>fires_wide</em> tibble.</p>
<p>The error also encouraged me to add some error handling in the form of the <em>try()</em> function which allows the script to keep running even if it gets a <strong>404 page not found</strong> response. I didn’t put the main link page scrape inside a try statement since there’s really no point to running the rest of the script if it can’t download the links.</p>
<p>The next step would be to combine some, or possible all, of the info in the <em>details_narrow</em> tibble with the <em>fires_wide</em> tibble, but first let’s talk about wide vs narrow data.</p>
</div>
<div id="wide-vs-narrow" class="section level2">
<h2>Wide vs narrow</h2>
<p>A wide format is similar to the familiar spreadsheet format where each observation (row) represents a complete record with each piece of information associated with the record in a separate column. It’s easy to read but not so easy to analyze.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the <em>fires_wide</em> tibble:</p>

<p>A narrow format (also known as “tidy” data in the R community, hence “tidyverse”) typically has one observation (row) for each piece of information with the other columns in the observation representing IDs or descriptors that tell you what the information belongs to and what it represents. It’s useful for graphing.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>details_narrow</em> tibble:</p>

<p>Just from eyeballing the information, I can see a few problems. One is that the latitude and longitude of each fire is combined into a single record “coordinates.” To use the data for mapping, those need to be pulled into their own categories.</p>
<p>Another is that the “current_as_of” values are a javascript statement designed to convert a date string to a date value. It would be more useful to extract the date value, get rid of the rest, and then convert the date value into a date variable. I’ll skip that last step, however, since it would prevent me from converting the data back to a narrow format.</p>
<div id="latitude-and-longitude" class="section level3">
<h3>Latitude and longitude</h3>
<p>Taking a look at the values in the coordinates category, there is an obvious pattern: <number> latitude, -<number> longitude. We can use str_extract() to pull out the numbers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>details_wide &lt;- details_wide %&gt;% 
  mutate(latitude = str_extract(coordinates,pattern=&#39;\\d+\\.\\d+&#39;),
         longitude = str_extract(coordinates,pattern=&#39;-\\d+\\.\\d+&#39;))</code></pre>
<p>The current_as_of values also have a clear pattern. In particular, the info we want is between two double-quote marks. A further complication is the format for the time which includes the -05:00 to show the offset from UTC.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>details_wide &lt;- details_wide %&gt;% 
  mutate(current_as_of = str_extract(current_as_of,pattern=&#39;\\&quot;.*?\\&quot;&#39;))</code></pre>
<p>I don’t see any other data issues other than a lot of missing values, so I’m going to combine the the two wide tibbles. If I need narrow info, such as for graphing, I’ll extract it out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fire_info_wide &lt;- merge(fires_wide, details_wide,by=&#39;incident&#39;)</code></pre>
