      <description>From the Pew Research Center’s “2018 Local News Survey” is an interesting example of how the answer to a data analysis changes when you flip the question.
The data comes from the first two questions, which asked 34,897 people to rate the quality of living in their communities and how attached they feel to those communities.
LOCALRATING: Overall, how would you rate your community as a place to live?</description>

      <description>If you’re not sure whether you like the direction the country is heading toward, how likely are you to approve of President Trump’s job performance?
Taking a look at the Pew Research Center’s “September 2018 Political Survey,” the latest dataset publicly available on the center’s site, https://www.pewresearch.org/download-datasets/, the answer surprises me at least.
So if you’re not sure about the country’s direction, there’s a roughly equal chance that you approve of Trump’s job performance, disapprove or aren’t sure.</description>

      <description>IntroJust some general notes as I try to learn how to use Bayes statistics. Take everything with a large grain of salt since there’s a reasonable chance I’ll get some of it wrong.
The underlying idea is that the Bayes’ Theorem allows you to refine your grasp on reality by using new evidence to modify your understanding.
Terminology:
P(A): probability of Event A.
P(B): probability of Event B.</description>

      <description>Bella has usurped Molly but Buddy can’t be beat when it comes to the most frequent names on dog licenses in Allegheny County.
The data comes from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center, https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-dog-licenses. It includes dogs licensed within the county but not those licensed inside the city of Pittsburgh.
County dog owners like a lot of variety in their pets’ names. While top names for each gender accont for about 400 to 500 names, about 30,000 dogs are licensed every year with the number of unique names ranging from 7,031 in 2016 to 8,929 in 2008.</description>
